"""
Multithreading and Multiprocessing are equally effective in IO heavy tasks. With more workers, the time spent over the total tasks decreases from ~ 10 seconds (1 worker) to 1.3 seconds (8 workers), which represents around 8X speed-boosting.
Multithreading does not work well on CPU heavy tasks. The red bar chart shows regardless of how many threads are used, the total time spent is constantly around 10 seconds.
Multiprocessing is effective over CPU heavy tasks, however, it reaches a plateau under hardware limits. In my case, it is when worker # is â‰¥ 5, its maximum speed-boosting is still 5X (~2 seconds), less than their actual worker # (e.g. 6, 7, 8). This is because my laptop has 6 cores, and given the system requires 1 core to maintain its functions, the rest 5 cores can be used for computing, hence maximum speed boosting is 5X.
